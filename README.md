UIWebView-Remote-Inspector
==========================

This app enables you to use the WebInspector for webpages directly on
your iOS device. It presents the webpage under test and the WebInspector
in two distinct web views, swiping switches between the two.

Thanks to [Nathan de Vries][1] for some inspiration.
